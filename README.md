# AuthorshipRecognition
Final project for Big Data course in UNIVR.  
The goal of this project is to use the Gutenberg Dataset(https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~lahiri/gutenberg_dataset.html), split it into training and test, and extract writeprints of authors using SPARK. Finally use them to classify the test set.
